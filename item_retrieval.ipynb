Once you soak it in water though, it becomes very soft and malleable. The sponge alone is a 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser on the other hand isn't a favorite of mine. It does not have an inner seal and the smell is just meh. I don't know how another reviewer got a citrus smell since the ingredients don't include fragrance.

       "2                                        5673      I like the sponge that comes with it. It comes wrapped in plastic and feels very hard, like a pumice stone. Once you soak it in water though, it becomes very soft and malleable. The sponge alone is a 5/5.<br /><br />The cleanser on the other hand isn't a favorite of mine. It does not have an inner seal and the smell is just meh. I don't know how another reviewer got a citrus smell since the ingredients don't include fragrance. I think the cleanser is a little too harsh and drying for my skin, it might be better for people with very oily skin.\\n442674                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This is a great cleanser your face feels nice and smooth afterwards it got all the gunk off my face when I had when I have my moisturizer and stuff on and gets it all off great buy for the money\\nName: text, dtype: object   \n",
